The scope of this document is to provide an overview of the usage of
`deluminator`.

# Configuration

`deluminator` uses enviroment variables for its configuration, you can find
the full list of variables in [this document](/docs/variables.md).

# User interface

Each of the following sections of the document represents an item in the main
menu of the application:

- [Playground](#playground)
- [Q&A](#q&a)
- [Dashboards](#dashboards)
- [Reports](#reports)

Please *note* this document serves as a product roadmap at the moment, the
idea is to describe all the features we want to have for a beta version of the
application and then build each section.

## Playground

The playground is the place where users explore their datasets. The interface
presents a SQL editor, a data source selector and  call to action that runs
queries. It looks like this:
