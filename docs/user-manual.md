The scope of this document is to provide an overview of the usage of
`deluminator`.

# Configuration

To configure `deluminator`, you can use enviroment variables. You can find the
full list of variables in [this document](/docs/variables.md).

Each of the following sections of the document represents an item in the main
menu of the application:

- [Playground](#playground)
- [Q&A](#q&a)

application and then build each section.
