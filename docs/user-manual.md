# User Manual

The scope of this document is to provide an overview of all the features
`deluminator` provides. Each section of the document represents an item in the
main menu of the application:

- [Playground](#playground)
- [Q&A](#q&a)
- [Dashboards](#dashboards)
- [Reports](#reports)

Please *note* this document serves as a product roadmap at the moment, the
idea is to describe all the features we want to have for a beta version of the
application and then build each section.
