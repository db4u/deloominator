# To Do

## Issues to create

Here is a list of things I want to fix but I can do out of the alpha phase as
they are non critical to the product.

- Add an automate step to the build process in order to have a full list of
  env vars the app understands. It's good to have it that way so we can
  validate the input at startup better. We can use the Usage function for
  envconfing (it's pretty nice!)
